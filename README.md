# Vim Tutorial
vim / vi is a powerful text editor with a small footprint. It’s been used for years
and is a useful tool to know.  

Even if you don’t want to use vim as your primary editor, it’s beneficial to know so that when you are logged into an external server, you can still manipulate files with ease using vim.
